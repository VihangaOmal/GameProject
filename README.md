# GameProject
This proposal aims to guide the development of a browser-based 2D game titled Little Larry Game. The project will enhance my technical skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and basic game logic, while also improving my problem-solving, creativity, and time management abilities through building a playable web game from scratch.
